# -API-INTEGRATION-AND-DATA-VISUALIZATION

**For my first task during the Python internship, I developed a simple yet functional Weather Application using Python. The goal of this task was to explore how API integration works and how to fetch real-time data from a third-party service (in this case, weather information) and present it in a user-friendly way.

This was my very first time working with APIs in Python, so I took this opportunity to explore the entire process from scratch — from understanding the logic to writing the code and fixing the errors on my own.

Project Overview:

The Weather App allows users to input the name of any city, and it returns the current weather data, such as:

 Temperature (in °C)

 Weather description (e.g., Cloudy, Rainy, etc.)

 Wind speed

 Sunrise and  Sunset times (converted into readable format)

And more depending on the available data from the API


All of this information is retrieved using the OpenWeatherMap API, which I integrated into my Python script.

 Tools and Technologies Used:

Language: Python 3.9

IDE: PyCharm (Community Edition)

API: OpenWeatherMap API

Libraries: requests, datetime, json

External Sources Used:

GeeksforGeeks – for Python syntax and API handling examples.

QuickRest.me – for testing and visualizing API responses before integrating.

YouTube channels like CodeWithHarry, ProgrammingWithMosh, and a few other smaller creators who helped simplify complex concepts.

Stack Overflow – for debugging various errors and finding solutions to common issues like module import problems or formatting datetime responses.

ChatGPT – for small coding doubts and guidance on best practices.

 What I Learned:

This task was full of learning curves. Some key takeaways include:

API Integration: I learned how to generate an API key, how to make GET requests, and how to handle JSON responses using the requests library.

Error Handling: I learned to handle basic exceptions like wrong city input, connectivity issues, and missing data using try and except.

Data Formatting: I understood how to convert Unix timestamps (for sunrise and sunset) into a human-readable format using Python's datetime module.

Debugging: I got stuck multiple times with module errors like ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests', but I learned to install missing packages via pip and verify the interpreter setup in PyCharm.

Self-Reliance: Even though I referred to many tutorials and articles, I wrote the entire code by myself and didn’t just copy-paste it. I made sure I understood what each line meant and modified it to fit my project requirements.

 Challenges Faced:

Initially, I struggled to set up the correct version of Python that would work with all necessary libraries. After several attempts, I settled on Python 3.9, which worked well for this project.

Formatting temperature and adding the degree symbol “°C” required a little research.

Choosing the right URL and parameters for the OpenWeatherMap API call was also tricky at first.



---

 Final Outcome:

The final output is a command-line-based Weather App that is fully functional. It responds to user input and displays real-time weather updates in a clear format. I am proud of this project because it was done entirely by myself with guidance only from online resources, and it marks the beginning of my Python journey into real-world applications.

This task gave me hands-on experience with real-life programming, debugging, and using third-party services. I now feel more confident about taking on larger and more complex projects in the upcoming tasks.
